flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/splash.png
    - images/logo.jpg
    - images/1.jpg
    - images/launcher.png
    - images/logoo.png
    - images/onboarding1.png
    - images/onboarding1.png
    - images/
    - assets/translations/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SourGummy
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Sour_Gummy/static/SourGummy-Medium.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/SourGummy-MedExpSlant.otf
    #         style: italic
    - family: Sour
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SourGummy-MedExpSlant.otf #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
